# Project Overview

This project is a web-based user interface for ActivityWatch, an open-source automated time tracker. It allows users to analyze their tracked activities and analyze their time usage.

## Main Technologies

*   **Frontend:** svelte
*   **Backend:**  ActivityWatch REST API, OpenAPI (Swagger) 2.0

## Architecture

The application is a single-page application (SPA) that runs entirely in the browser. It communicates with a local ActivityWatch server to fetch and manipulate data.

## Key Files

*   `input/swagger.json`: The OpenAPI (Swagger) 2.0 specification for the ActivityWatch REST API. This is the most important file in the project, as it describes all the available API endpoints, their parameters, and their responses.
*   `input/*.json`: Sample data from the ActivityWatch API. These files can be used to understand the structure of the data returned by the API.
